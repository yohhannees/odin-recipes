    <p>INGREDIENTS
  
        ½ cup oil
        ½ cup chickpea flour
        2 medium onions pureed
        1 roma tomato pureed
        4 cloves of garlic chopped
        2 tablespoons niter kibbeh Ethiopian spiced clarified butter
        2 to 2 ½ cups of water
        3 tablespoons berbere spice
        1 teaspoon garlic powder
        ¼ teaspoon sugar
        Salt to taste
        1 jalepeno chopped (optional)
        INSTRUCTIONS
         
        Bring a heavy bottom stockpot to medium heat. Add pureed onions to the dry pan, and saute until they become dry and start to take on color- about 4-5 minutes. Add the oil and berbere spice. Saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
        Next add tomato and chopped garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes more.
        Now start whisking in about half of the chickpea flour. Gradually start to add about 1 cup of water. Whisk in the remaining chickpea flour and an additional 1 cup of water. Whisk until mixture is very smooth. Add remaining ½ cup of water if you prefer your shiro a little thinner.
        Heat until the shiro begins to pop (simmer). Then add the niter kibbeh, garlic powder, sugar, and salt to taste, stirring until combined.
        Simmer for about 5-10 minutes over low heat until the flavors combine and the oil separates slightly from the shiro.
        Garnish with jalepeno, if desired.
        Serve with fresh injera.</p>
